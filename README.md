# ThirdFund

ThirdFund is an app for users to launch crowdfunding campaigns for their projects, and backers could make contributions in the form of Mantle($BIT Tokens). The platform could use smart contracts to automatically distribute funds to the creators once the campaign's funding goal has been met, providing a secure and transparent way to manage the funding process.
